When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
当我想向别人分享的时候，以及重要的项目要确保文件的安全性的时候。


说明Fork、克隆和分支之间的不同。何时使用某种功能而不是另一种？
Fork 是从远程仓库中建一个自己的版本，对版本的修改不会影响源版本。需要在某个版本上创建自己的版本，且自己的修改不影响源版本。
克隆 是从远程仓库复制到本地。需要在本地编辑某一个版本的时候。
分支 是同一个版本的某一阶段不同的版本。需要修复主版本的 Bug 、做一些新功能版本、创建特殊的版本。
